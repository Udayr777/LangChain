       "\"\\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the total economic output of a country. It represents the monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period of time, usually a year. GDP is often used as an indicator of a country's overall economic health and is a key factor in determining the standard of living and economic growth.\\n\\nThere are three main components that make up GDP: consumption, investment, and government spending. Consumption refers to the total amount of money spent by individuals and households on goods and services, such as food, housing, and transportation. Investment includes business spending on capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, as well as new construction and research and development. Government spending includes all expenditures on public goods and services, such as education, defense, and infrastructure.\\n\\nGDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all goods and services produced in a country, including both final goods and intermediate goods. Final goods are those that are consumed by end-users, while intermediate goods are used in the production of other goods and services. GDP also takes into account the value of exports and subtracts the value of imports, as these represent goods and services that are produced outside of the country.\\n\\nOne important thing to note is\""
